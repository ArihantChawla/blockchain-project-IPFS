\chapter{Possible Problems}

\section{Is IPFS really permanent?}

Although IPFS promises a web where the content is permanent and information cannot be destroyed, it hardly does that. This claim assumes that all of the data is being shared and pinned by lots of people. Before filecoin is in action I don't see any reason why that would happen. It is possible that I upload some content, a few people access it (but none of them pins it), then I delete the content from my node and a few hours later it's gone from IPFS. Currently the IPFS team have their own nodes which look for newly uploaded data continuously and pin it. But this cannot be expected of a rational node in the system.

\section{What about pirated data?}
Another problem is that if the content is permanent, then there is no way to remove pirated data or other illegal data from IPFS once it's uploaded. This might create a legal barrier for global acceptance of IPFS as a backbone of the web. There have been some discussions about creating blocklists which people can subscribe to and the files mentioned in those blocklists won't be ever downloaded on their machine. But who will maintain these lists? Who makes sure legit data isn't added to those list?
