\chapter{Conclusion}

IPFS has used a bunch of great ideas from decades of academic research and open source projects. Ultimately, it is designed to change the web as we know it. It aims to fix some of the major problems with HTTP, one of the most successful protocols ever.

IPFS aims for a completely distributed web where the users can trust the content without trusting their peers. At a bare minimum, it can be used as a global distributed file system. At its best, it could lead us to a faster, more secure, uncensored and permanent web.
