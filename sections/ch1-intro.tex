\chapter{Introduction}

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Benet14} is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that aims to upgrade how the web works currently. It combines various research ideas to create a web which is distributed, safer, smarter, faster and permanent.

The current HTTP protocol for sharing data over the web does not take advantage of the various brilliant file distribution techniques that have emerged in the previous few decades. HTTP powers a large portion of the internet today, making it almost impossible to replace. IPFS wants to achieve this change in a way that the end users do not have to change how they use the web. A lot of engineering effort is being put in to gain wide acceptance and fit into the existing infrastructure as smoothly as possible.
